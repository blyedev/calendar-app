# Blyedev's Calendar App

This repository is NOT a finished product but my staging ground for new and exciting tech. It has rarely ever worked as a complete app. Nonetheless it is my pride and joy.

## Why calendars

At first the idea was born to create a calendar for me and me only that would codify my approach to time tracking. That specific approach utilizes the principles of cost accounting. Each cost center focuses on a specific task such as cooking. I track the cumulative time it requires and to which other cost centers do I attribute the cost.

Existing calendars such as google calendar, allow for tracking time in this way. What they don't do is provide a dashboard with metrics I care about divided by cost centers. For that reason long ago I decided to work on my own calendar. First implementing the calendar itself then the tailored aspect.

Keeping my current pace while following the roadmap I plan to finish this app in the late 2030s. Meaning I don't plan to finish it at all. It has become a testing ground for new build tools, status checks or CI/CD pipelines. I sometimes write features following my initial plan, but nowadays I only ever do it to test my workflow.
